- Installation and usage of ITDT does not make any changes to or leave any traces in the system configuration.
- Only a folder "ITDT" is created which contains the ITDT program file and 2 subfolders initially:
    - "license" folder with license files in different languages.
    - "scripts" folder for additional scripts.
- When executing the program for the first time 2 more subfolders will be created in the "ITDT" folder:
    - "input" folder for firmware files to be uploaded to devices.
    - "output" folder for generated log and dump files.
- To remove ITDT from your system simply erase the ITDT folder.
